    "# 🏫 Understanding All Class Relationships in OOP (with Tricky Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, classes rarely exist in isolation. These relationships tell us **how classes interact, depend on, or contain each other**, including **what happens if objects are deleted**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **four main relationships** are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1️⃣ **Inheritance** – “is-a” relationship\n",
    "2️⃣ **Association** – “uses” relationship\n",
    "3️⃣ **Aggregation** – “has-a” relationship (weak)\n",
    "4️⃣ **Composition** – “has-a” relationship (strong)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣ **Inheritance** — “is-a” relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plain English:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> One class **is a type of** another class.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The child class **inherits** properties and methods from the parent class.\n",
    "* It’s like **reusing** or **extending** code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **Dog** is an **Animal** → Dog inherits features of Animal\n",
    "* A **Tesla** is a **Car** → Tesla inherits features of Car\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, brand):\n",
    "        self.brand = brand\n",
    "\n",
    "    def start(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.brand} car starting...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Tesla(Car):  # Tesla is a Car\n",
    "    def __init__(self, brand, autopilot):\n",
    "        super().__init__(brand)\n",
    "        self.autopilot = autopilot\n",
    "\n",
    "    def enable_autopilot(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.brand} Autopilot: {self.autopilot}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage & Deletion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "tesla = Tesla(\"Model S\", True)\n",
    "tesla.start()             # inherited\n",

    "\n",
    "del tesla\n",
    "# Tesla object is deleted, but Car class still exists\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tricky Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Overriding:** Child can replace parent method; use `super()` to access parent.\n",
    "2. **Multiple inheritance:** Can cause diamond problem (method resolution order matters).\n",
    "3. **Deleting child:** Only the object is deleted; parent class code remains.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2️⃣ **Association** — “uses” relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plain English:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> One class **uses** another class temporarily.\n",
    "> Objects are **independent**; no ownership.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **Driver drives a Car** → Driver uses Car\n",
    "* A **Teacher teaches Student** → Teacher uses Student\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Driver:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",

    "    def __init__(self, brand):\n",
    "        self.brand = brand\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage & Deletion:**\n",
    "\n",

    "car = Car(\"BMW\")\n",

    "# Driver still exists and can drive another car\n",
    "driver.drive(Car(\"Audi\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tricky Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. No ownership → deleting the used object does **not delete the user object**.\n",
    "2. Loose coupling → flexible, but beware of dangling references.\n",
    "3. Can use **any compatible object**; objects are not tied together.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3️⃣ **Aggregation** — “has-a” relationship (weak ownership)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plain English:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> One class **contains another**, but contained object can **exist independently**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **School has Teachers** → teachers can exist outside school\n",
    "* A **Car has Engine** → engine can exist independently\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Example:**\n",

    "```python\n",
    "class Engine:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, power):\n",
    "        self.power = power\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, model, engine):\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "        self.engine = engine  # aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "    def show(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.model} with {self.engine.power} HP engine\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage & Deletion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "engine = Engine(400)\n",
    "car1 = Car(\"Mustang\", engine)\n",
    "car2 = Car(\"Camaro\", engine)  # same engine reused\n",
    "\n",
    "del car1\n",
    "print(engine.power)  # 400 -> engine still exists\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tricky Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Shared object:** Modifying engine affects all cars sharing it.\n",
    "2. **Deleting container:** Engine still exists → weak ownership.\n",
    "3. Can reuse contained object in multiple containers.\n",
    "4. Beware of accidental modification if object is shared.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4️⃣ **Composition** — “has-a” relationship (strong ownership)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plain English:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> One class **owns** another class completely.\n",
    "> If the main class is destroyed, the contained class **also disappears**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **Human has a Heart** → heart cannot exist independently\n",
    "* A **House has Rooms** → rooms vanish if house is destroyed\n",

    "\n",
    "del tesla\n",
    "# tesla.battery is also deleted\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tricky Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Contained object cannot exist independently → strong ownership.\n",
    "2. Lifecycle of part depends on container.\n",
